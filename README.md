# Indian Currency Recognition
Recognition of Indian currency notes into 7 categories(10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 2000)  

# Introduction    
The model is developed using fine-tuning a pre-trained model 'Xception' in Keras on custom dataset.   
There are total 550 images are used to train a model to recognize the currency into 7 classes.   
The model got more than 90% accuracy for all the classes on test dataset, which composed around 80 images.   

# Dependancy   
- Python  
- Tensorflow  
- Numpy   
- Matplotlib   
     
# Further Improvements  
Although, I have used a Image augmentation techniques to improve the accuracy, But Training accuracy   
can be further increased by collecting more training data.
